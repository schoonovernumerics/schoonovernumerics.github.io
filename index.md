## Software Development and Applications
  [ ![useful image](SELF-icon.png) ](https://schoonovernumerics.github.io/SELF/) 

## Highlights from this week
Working on Open Sourcing the Fast Equilibration of Ocean Tracers Software (FEOTS).
 
### SELF Updates
 The SELF has gone private. 
 If you would like access to the SELF, let me know what applications you have in mind and I will be happy to work with you to curate a solution to your numerical problems.
