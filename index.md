# Welcome to Joe's Projects Page
This page serves as a place to document my ongoing software development and application projects.

## [Resume](schoonover_cv.pdf)

**Interests** : Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Data Visualization

**Skills** : Fortran, GPU Programming (CUDA, OpenACC), Distributed computing (MPI), Shared Memory Computing (OpenMP), Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Methods, Analytical methods for hyperbolic PDEs

## Highlights from this week
Working on Open Sourcing the Fast Equilibration of Ocean Tracers Software (FEOTS).
 
### SELF Updates
 I am preparing a cleaned up release of the SELF modules. High end solver source code will remain private, but can be made available for individual academic and research usage upon request.


### Numerical Simulation of the Week
